# Grinding

The researcher's word for the claim-by-claim check of `main.md` against its sources. Read AGENTS.md first; its rules (never invent citations or findings, `notes.md` is read-only, surgical changes) apply throughout.

The argument names one source, for example `Hayakawa`, `Lee 2026` or `Park 2025`.

## Steps

1. **Find the section.** Match the argument to a `## <Author> et al. (<year>)` heading in `docs/claims-by-source.md` (a ✅ in front of the heading only means all boxes are ticked). If several headings match (Lee 2024 and Lee 2026, Park 2025 and Park 2026) or none does, ask which one and stop.
2. **Read the section:** the "Local file" and status line, every claim `(n)` with its `- >` lines (the current sentences of `main.md` with line numbers) and the Pointers line. Check the line numbers against `main.md` itself; if the `- >` lines are stale, say so and use the current text.
3. **Read the source in full,** not only the pages named in Pointers. Use the Read tool on the PDF; if that fails (for example `pdftoppm` missing), run `python -I scripts/render_pdf_pages.py raw/<file>.pdf --text` and read `figure_analysis/<name>/text.txt`. Read supplementary files in `raw/` when a claim depends on them. For a claim that rests on a figure, render and view that page.
4. **Check each claim** against the passage that supports or contradicts it, with its page (and figure or table). Look in particular for:
   - wording stronger than the source ("shown" where the source says "largely", "suggest", "may be linked", "appears");
   - numbers, units, ranges, cell types, species and conditions that differ from the source;
   - a condition or limitation of the source that the sentence in `main.md` drops;
   - parts of the sentence that are the author's own inference: name the register item in `docs/claims-by-source.md` that covers it, or say that none does;
   - the source disagreeing with itself (text versus figure caption): report both values;
   - errors in the wiki page or the Pointers line, even when `main.md` is not affected.
5. **Change nothing.** Report as below and wait.

## Report

Write in the language the researcher used; keep quotations in the original language. Use this shape:

1. One opening line: how the source was read (Read tool or text dump, figures or supplement if used), that no files were changed, and the overall verdict ("all six hold, two have a minor note").
2. A summary table:

   | # | Where in main.md | Verdict |
   |---|---|---|
   | 1 | Fiducial, line 110 | ✅ holds |

   Verdicts: ✅ holds, ✅ holds (with a short note), ⚠️ check (wording, a missing condition or a number), ❌ does not hold.
3. One section per claim, separated by `---`:

   ```
   ### (n) <short title>: <verdict>
   **main.md:<line>:** "<quoted sentence or the relevant part>"
   **Source:** "<quoted passage>" (p. X; Fig./Table if relevant)

   **Note:** <only if needed>
   **Suggestion:** <concrete new wording, only for ⚠️ or ❌>
   ```

   Translate the bold labels into the researcher's language.
4. A closing summary: what should be fixed, what is optional, and whether the claims are ready to be ticked. Offer the fixes; do not apply them.

Never tick a box yourself; ticking is the researcher's decision.

## When the researcher asks for fixes

Apply only the fixes named. Then, under the Draft rules of AGENTS.md:

- edit `main.md` surgically, and keep the matching claim in `docs/claims-by-source.md` in step (reword it, note the change and its date; when a claim is dropped or merged, renumber and update every reference to its number, such as the register);
- fix the wiki page and the Pointers line when they were wrong;
- add or update a register item for any new own inference;
- append a `wiki/log.md` entry (`draft` when `main.md` changed, otherwise `query`);
- run `python -I scripts/claim_quotes.py --write`, `python -I scripts/check.py` and, if `main.md` changed, `python -I scripts/check_abbreviations.py`;
- end with a proposed commit message in the style the researcher uses.

## When not to use it

Deciding whether a claim should stay in the paper at all, or how strongly to state it: use `/grill-paper`. Register items of the author's own inferences have no source to check against; there the researcher decides whether they stand behind the wording.
